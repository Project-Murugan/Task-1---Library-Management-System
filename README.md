# Task-1---Library-Management-System

The purpose of this project is to design a Library Management System using SQL to efficiently manage books, members, and borrowing transactions. It involves creating and populating three core tables—Books, Members, and BorrowingRecords—with appropriate relationships. The system supports data retrieval and analysis to generate insights like overdue books, popular genres, and member activity.
